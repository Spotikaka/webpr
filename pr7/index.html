                <p>When there is no more hope. When Winter is coming. When the White Walkers prepare to break down the
                    Wall and JAVA can no

            <p>Comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components, he does not give up technical tasks "to do
                nicely" and is
                not afraid of calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of his faithful friends
                with him: jQuery,
                React.js and Node.js.</p>
